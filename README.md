# ESP32 PoolMaster

## Brief description
Complete pool management system which automates water maintenance and control.

### Measurement and control
System continuously monitors various metrics and periodically reports them over MQTT and touchscreen:
 - Water and Air Temperature
 - Water pressure
 - pH (with temperature compensation)
 - Orp
 - Chlorine tank level
 - pH tank level
 - Water Level

pH and Orp are continuously adjusted thanks to two peristaltic pumps controlled by two PID regulation loops.

Below a short video presentation (french):

[![DESCRIPTION VIDEO](https://img.youtube.com/vi/WqgkL-VFOhA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqgkL-VFOhA) 

### Support many maintenance methods
 - Liquid Chlore
 - SWG (Salt Water Chlorine Generator) through external command and control
 - Liquid active Oxygen

Tank-levels are estimated based on the running-time and flow-rate of each pump. Additionnally a low level contact can be plugged into the system.
 
### Control (local and remote)
 - 3.5'' Nextion TFT touchscreen for local information and control
 - MQTT integration with home automation systems (Home Assistant, Jeedom, NodeRed, InfluxDB, Grafana, etc.)
 - Long term statistics
 - Phone App templates for home automation systems

### Automation
 - Filtration pump automation reduces energy consumption and adapt filtering time slots according to water temperature (70% of swimming pool energy consumption is for filter pump)
 - Thanks to its embedded RTC (Real Time Clock) the system keeps track of precise date/time even when powered off (Adjusted automatically via NTP or manually)
 - Winter mode reduces filtering at its minimum and ensure freezing protection (perfect for active filtering during winter)
 - 2 spare relay outputs for controlling external equipment (heating, lighting, etc.)

##  Project Details
### Features
This project is a fork of ESP32 Poolmaster by Gixy ([https://github.com/Gixy31/ESP32-PoolMaster](https://github.com/Gixy31/ESP32-PoolMaster)).

Gixy's project is a redesign for ESP32 of an initial project by Loic74650 [(https://github.com/Loic74650/PoolMaster](https://github.com/Loic74650/PoolMaster)) which was intended for Atmega2560 MCUs.

Project includes ESP code and three PCB designs for:
- The main control board
- The pH/Orp acquisition board
- The main control board (extended interface version)

The main unit interfaces with a 3.5'' Nextion touchscreen for local information and control.
It includes Wifi connectivity to communicate via MQTT and SMTP. Project includes configuration files for various home automation systems such as Home Assistant, Jeedom, NodeRed, Grafana, etc.

Finally code and PCB are made with high flexibility to precisely tailor the features to the user.

### Work in Progress
Below the main features to be implemented:
- As of today, the Salt Water Chlorine Generator mode switches the chlorinator ON when Orp reaches 90% of setpoint and OFF when it reaches 105%. Unless pH and Orp regulation with pump there is not PID style logic. This would need evolving with possibly a longer PID window value to avoid switching chlorinator ON/OFF too frequently.
- Ability to configure all the setpoints, PID Windows, Pump Flow Rates, PSI Thresholds on the Nextion (not much work)

### Hardware
A dedicated board has been designed to host all components. There are 8 LEDs at the bottom to display status, warnings and alarms.
Below two examples of live deployments:

![Project Hardware](https://github.com/christophebelmont/ESP32-PoolMaster/blob/main/docs/Hardware2.png)

An extended board is also available which includes additional interfaces as well as a second ESP32 slot for watchdog and remote maintenance. This is particularly useful for remote pool management features such as:
- Logs sent to cloud (and long term storage & statistics)
- ESP32 power toggle switch (if reboot needed)
- Over-the-Internet software upgrades (for PoolMaster and Nextion screen)
- Alarm Buzzer included onto the board
- External 5V output to power additional device

### Software
The ESP32 project isn't a fork of the ATmega2560 original one due to the different structure of source files with PlatformIO ((.cpp, .h). 
It includes:
 - Management of ESP32 and Wifi
 - ESP32-Arduino framework with PlatformIO IDE
 - Async MQTT Client
 - JSON upgrade to version 6
 - Async Analog measurement via external I2C ADS115

The version V6, (aka ESP-2.0) implement direct usage of FreeRTOS functions for managing tasks and queues. There are 10 tasks sharing the app_CPU :

| Ref| Task|  Description                | Run every|Offset|

###  Tips
Before attempting to regulate your pool water with this automated system, it is essential that you start with:
 1. testing your water quality (using liquid kits and/or test strips for instance) and balancing it properly (pH, Chlorine, Alkalinity, Hardness). Proper water balancing will greatly ease the pH stability and regulation
 2. calibrating the pH probe using calibrated buffer solutions (pay attention to the water temperature which plays a big role in pH readings)
 3. adjusting pH to 7.4
 4. once above steps 1 to 3 are ok, you can start regulating ORP

Notes: 
 - the ORP sensor should theoretically not be calibrated nor temperature compensated (by nature its 0mV pivot point cannot shift) 
  - the ORP reading is strongly affected by the pH value and the water temperature. Make sure pH is adjusted at 7.4 
   - prefer platinium ORP probes for setpoints >500mV (ie. Pools and spas)
   - the response time of ORP sensors can be fast in reference buffer solutions (10 secs) and yet very slow in pool water (minutes or more) as it depends on the water composition

###  Details on the PID regulation
In this project the Arduino PID library is used to start/stop the chemicals pumps in a cyclic manner, similar to a "PWM" signal.
The period of the cycle is defined by the WINDOW SIZE parameter which is fixed (in Milliseconds). What the PID library does is vary the duty cycle of the cycle.
If the computed error in the PID loop is null or negative, the duty cycle is set to zero (the ouput of the function PID.Compute()) and the pump is never actuated.
If the error is positive, the duty cycle is set to a value between 0 and a max value (equal to the WINDOW SIZE, ie. the pump is running full time).

So in practice the ouput of the PID.Compute() function is a duration in milliseconds during which the pump will be activated for every cycle.
If for instance, the WINDOW SIZE is set to 3600000ms (ie. one hour) and the output of the PID is 600000ms (ie. 10mins), the pump will be activated for 10mins at the begining of every hour cycle.

On the default Kp,Ki,Kd parameter values of the PID:
By default in this project, Ki and Kd are null for stability reasons and so the PID loop is only a P loop, ie. a proportional loop.
Adding some Ki and Kd to the PID loop may theoretically increase regulation performance but is also more complex to adjust and could result in instabilities. Since a P-only loop worked well enough and that safety considerations should be taken seriously in this project, I left it as is.

For my 50m3 pool the Kp default values are 2000000 for the pH loop and 4500 for the Orp loop. They were chosen experimentally in the following way:

I experimentally checked how much chemical was required to change the measured parameter (pH or Orp) by a certain amount. For instance I determined that 83ml of acid changed the pH by 0.1 for my 50m3 pool. The flow rate of the acid pump being 1.5L/hour, we can then determine for how many minutes the pump should be activated if the pH error is 0.1, which are (0.083*60/1.5) = 3.3minutes or roughly 200000ms.
And so for an error of 1 in the pH PID loop, the pump needs to be activated 10 times longer, ie. during 2000000ms, which should be taken as the Kp value. The same reasoning goes for the Kp value of the Orp PID loop.

On the WINDOW SIZE:
Various parameters influence the speed at which an injected chemical in the pool water will result in a variation in the measured pH or Orp.
Experimentally I measured that in my case it can take up to 30minutes and therefore the injection cycle period should be at least 30mins or longer in order not to inject more chemical over the following cycles thinking that it required more when in fact the chemical reactions simply needed more time to take effect, which would eventually result in overshooting. So in my case I setlled for a safe one hour WINDOW SIZE (ie. 3600000ms)
